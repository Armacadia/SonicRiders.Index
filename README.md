## About The Index

The PC Wiki is a community-maintained website created for the purpose of compiling resources, documenting file formats, and various other resources for Sonic Riders. 

The goal is to have a vast array of game knowledge all condensed into one area for easy reference and viewing. Think of it as an alternative to the [Sonic Community Hacking Guide (SCHG)](http://info.sonicretro.org/SCHG:Sonic_Community_Hacking_Guide).
