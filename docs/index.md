## About The Index

The PC Wiki is a community-maintained website created for the purpose of compiling resources, documenting file formats, and various other resources for Sonic Riders. 

The goal is to have a vast array of game knowledge all condensed into one area for easy reference and viewing. Think of it as an alternative to the [Sonic Community Hacking Guide (SCHG)](http://info.sonicretro.org/SCHG:Sonic_Community_Hacking_Guide).

## Repository Layout

- `Source`: Contains source code for the tools in this repository.
- `docs`: Contains the documentation you're looking at right now.
- `docs/files/template`: Specifications for various file formats. (010 Hex Editor Templates)

Please note that parts of this documentation are autogenerated using the `IndexTool`, whose source code is available in `Source/IndexTool`.
